# FPGA_Flappy-Bird

This entire folder will be about the FPGA Flappy Bird game, created by Alexandra Zuchowicz, Marisa Do Valle, and Belinda Truong in the Spring of 2023. This is a recreation and all credits go to the Flappy Bird creator.

If you would like to use it on your laptop you will need Terasic Technologies Terasic De10-Lite board, Intel FPGA Monitor Program, and the code itself. The main code is "flappyBird.c".

Enjoy!
